# MiniCPM-o 4.5 PyTorch Simple Demo System

[中文简介](README_zh.md) | [Detailed Documentation](https://openbmb.github.io/minicpm-o-4_5-pytorch-simple-demo/site/en/index.html)

[Ready-to-use Demo Website](https://35.226.63.1:8008/)

This demo system is officially provided by the `MiniCPM-o 4.5` model training team. It uses a PyTorch + CUDA inference backend, combined with a lightweight frontend-backend design, aiming to demonstrate the full audio-video omnimodal full-duplex capabilities of MiniCPM-o 4.5 in a transparent, concise, and lossless manner.

| Mode | Features | I/O Modalities | Paradigm
|------|----------|------|------
| **Turn-based Chat** | Low-latency streaming interaction; button-triggered responses; supports offline video/audio understanding and analysis; high response accuracy; strong basic capabilities | Audio + Text + Video input, Audio + Text output | Turn-based
| **Half-Duplex Audio** | VAD auto-detects speech boundaries for hands-free voice conversation; higher TTS voice quality; more accurate responses; stronger user experience | Voice input, Text + Voice output | Half-duplex
| **Omnimodal Full-Duplex** | Real-time omnimodal full-duplex interaction; visual and voice input with simultaneous voice output; model autonomously decides when to speak; powerful cutting-edge capabilities | Vision + Audio input, Text + Voice output | Full-duplex
| **Audio Full-Duplex** | Real-time audio full-duplex interaction; voice input and voice output happen simultaneously; model autonomously decides when to speak; powerful cutting-edge capabilities | Audio input, Text + Voice output | Full-duplex

The 4 currently supported modes share a single model instance with millisecond-level hot-switching (< 0.1ms).

**Additional features:**

- Customizable system prompts
- Customizable reference audio
- Simple and readable codebase for continual development
- Serve as API backend for third-party applications

## Architecture

```
Frontend (HTML/JS)
    |  HTTPS / WSS
Gateway (:8006, HTTPS)
    |  HTTP / WS (internal)
Worker Pool (:22400+)
    +-- Worker 0 (GPU 0)
    +-- Worker 1 (GPU 1)
    +-- ...
```

- **Frontend** — Mode selection homepage, Turn-based Chat, Omni / Audio Duplex full-duplex interaction, Admin Dashboard
- **Gateway** — Request routing and dispatching, WebSocket proxy, request queuing and session affinity
- **Worker** — Each Worker occupies one GPU exclusively, supports Turn-based Chat / Duplex protocols, Duplex supports pause/resume (auto-release on timeout)


## Quick Start

### Check System Requirements
1. Make sure you have an NVIDIA GPU with more than 28GB of VRAM.
2. Make sure your machine is running a Linux operating system.

### Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for video frame extraction and inference result visualization. For more information, visit the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/).

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Deployment Steps
**1. Install Python 3.10**

We recommend using miniconda to install Python 3.10.

```bash
mkdir -p ./miniconda3_install_tmp

# Download the miniconda3 installation script
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_25.11.1-1-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ./miniconda3_install_tmp/miniconda.sh 

# Install miniconda3 into the project directory
bash ./miniconda3_install_tmp/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ./miniconda3 
```

After installation, you will have an empty base environment. Activate this base environment, which uses Python 3.10 by default.

```bash
source ./miniconda3/bin/activate
python --version # Should display 3.10.x
```

**2. Install Dependencies for MiniCPM-o 4.5**

Using the `install.sh` script in the project directory is the fastest way. It creates a venv virtual environment named `base` under `.venv` in the project directory and installs all dependencies.

```bash
source ./miniconda3/bin/activate
bash ./install.sh
```

If you have a good network connection, the entire installation process takes about 5 minutes. If you are in China, consider using a third-party PyPI mirror such as the Tsinghua mirror.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual installation steps</summary>

You can also install dependencies manually in 2 steps:

```bash
# First, prepare an empty Python 3.10 environment
source ./miniconda3/bin/activate
python -m venv .venv/base
source .venv/base/bin/activate

# Install PyTorch
pip install "torch==2.8.0" "torchaudio==2.8.0"

# Install the remaining dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

**3. Create Configuration File**

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` in the project directory.

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

The model path (`model_path`) defaults to `openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5`. If you have access to Hugging Face, no modification is needed — the model will be automatically pulled from Hugging Face.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand detailed instructions about model path</summary>

(Optional) If you prefer to download model weights to a fixed location, or cannot access Hugging Face, you can modify `model_path` to your local model path.
```bash
# Install huggingface cli
pip install -U huggingface_hub

# Download the model
huggingface-cli download openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5 --local-dir /path/to/your/MiniCPM-o-4_5

```

If you cannot access Hugging Face, you can use the following two methods to download the model in advance.

- Download the model using hf-mirror

```bash
pip install -U huggingface_hub

export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com

huggingface-cli download openbmb/MiniCPM-o-4_5 --local-dir /path/to/your/MiniCPM-o-4_5
```

- Download the model using ModelScope

```bash
pip install modelscope

modelscope download --model OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o-4_5 --local_dir /path/to/your/MiniCPM-o-4_5
```

Modify `"gateway_port": 8006` to change the deployment port. The default is 8006.


**4. Start the Service**
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash start_all.sh
```

After the service starts, visit https://localhost:8006. The self-signed certificate will trigger a browser warning — click "Advanced" → "Proceed" to continue.

**5. torch.compile Acceleration**

On older-generation GPUs such as A100 and RTX 4090, the per-unit computation time in Omni Full-Duplex mode is approximately 0.9s, approaching the 1-second real-time threshold and causing noticeable stuttering. `torch.compile` uses Triton to compile core sub-modules into optimized GPU kernels, reducing computation time to approximately **0.5s** — meeting real-time requirements for smooth, stutter-free interaction.

Three steps to enable:

**5a.** Enable compilation in `config.json`:

```json
{ "service": { "compile": true } }
```

**5b.** Run the pre-compilation script (one-time, ~15 min):

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR=./torch_compile_cache .venv/base/bin/python precompile.py
```

Pre-compilation generates optimized Triton kernels and saves them to the `./torch_compile_cache` directory (`start_all.sh` reads the compilation cache from `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR`). The cache persists on disk and is automatically loaded on all subsequent starts (including process restarts), with no need to recompile.

**5c.** Start the service:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash start_all.sh
```

Workers automatically load the cached kernels from `./torch_compile_cache`. Loading takes approximately 5 minutes when the cache is available.

<summary>Click to expand other startup options</summary>

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 bash start_all.sh          # Specify GPUs
bash start_all.sh --http                             # Downgrade to HTTP (not recommended, mic/camera APIs require HTTPS)
```

**Manual Startup (step by step):**
```bash
# Worker (one per GPU)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 PYTHONPATH=. .venv/base/bin/python worker.py --worker-index 0 --gpu-id 0

# Gateway
PYTHONPATH=. .venv/base/bin/python gateway.py --port 10024 --workers localhost:22400
```
</details>

**5. Stop the Service:**
```bash
pkill -f "gateway.py|worker.py"
```

## Known Issues and Improvement Plans

- In Turn-based Chat mode, image input is temporarily unavailable — only audio and text input are supported. An image Q&A mode will be split out soon.
- Half-duplex voice call (no button required to trigger responses) is under development and will be merged soon.
- In Audio Full-Duplex mode, echo cancellation currently has issues affecting interruption success rate. Using headphones is recommended. A fix is coming soon.
- In voice mode, due to the model's training strategy, Chinese and English calls require corresponding language system prompts.
